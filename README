To build the JAVA part:
ant dist

To build the native part:

  cd src/native/unix; configure; make
  You need a gnu make.
  The jsvc executable could be found in dist.
  There is a INSTALL.txt src/native/unix please have a look to it.

  On windoze the additional step is needed:
  cd src/native/nt; make
  There is a README in src/native/nt please have a look to it.
  The exe files are created in dist.

  procrun is only for windows
  cd src/native/nt/procrun; make
  (It is also possible to use the m$ developement tools).
